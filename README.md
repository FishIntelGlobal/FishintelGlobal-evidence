# FIG LTD — FishIntel Global Evidence Repository

**Forensic Maritime Foreseeability Intelligence**

---

## Overview

FIG LTD is building the world's first maritime foreseeability intelligence system — proving, with forensic-grade evidence, that weather conditions at the time and location of fishing vessel incidents **were knowable in advance**.

This repository contains our published research and evidence methodology.

## White Paper: LIMITLESS & WEAPON

**[FIG_WhitePaper_V2.1_PUBLIC.pdf](FIG_WhitePaper_V2.1_PUBLIC.pdf)** — Our primary research paper detailing:

- **125 MAIB-investigated fishing vessel incidents** (2014–2024) reconstructed using ERA5 reanalysis data
- **ERA5 weather reconstruction** at 0.25° spatial resolution and hourly timesteps, covering every incident location
- **Blockchain-timestamped evidence** — 12 batches of cryptographic hashes anchored to the Polygon blockchain, creating immutable proof of what was known and when
- **LIMITLESS** — Five-tier risk classification system for maritime conditions
- **WEAPON** — Six-stage forensic evidence pipeline (Weather reconstruction → Evidence packaging → Attribution analysis → Probability assessment → Outcome pathways → Negligence framework)
- **Cost-benefit analysis** using DfT Value of Prevented Fatality methodology
- **Legal framework** — Caparo foreseeability test, Civil Evidence Act 1995, blockchain admissibility

## Key Finding

> In every case analysed, ERA5 reanalysis confirms that the hazardous conditions which contributed to the incident were present in the meteorological record — and therefore **foreseeable** using data available at the time.
